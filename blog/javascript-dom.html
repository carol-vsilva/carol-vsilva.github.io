            <h3>28 November 2021</h3>

            <p>The fundamental coding languages of the internet are HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are different components of the majority of the websites available nowadays. Let’s think of them as three buddies:
                <un><li>HTLM is the builder - responsible for the structure and the content of the page.</li>
                <li>CSS is the artist.  It will be storing the design and layout - such as colours, spacing or fonts.</li>
                <li>And JavaScript is the wizard that brings an interactive face to the website, adding pop-ups or auto-completing fields as example.</li></un></p>

            <p>The DOM is an interface that allows the interaction of JavaScript coding with the HTML structure. It uses a tree style to keep the HTML structure under control, considering how the objects are laid down inside the document. When we find the specific element on this tree that needs to be changed, we use JavaScript coding to add, delete or change its content. Let’s suppose that you need to modify the background of a specific line of the page. Instead of opening the HTML and CSS documents, it can get done in just one line of coding using JavaScript language.</p>
            <p>Back to JavaScript now, the computer will read the code starting from the first line till the last line. Unless, of course, some instructions in the code changes this control flow. Some of the well-known functions are the conditionals and the loops. Conditionals are instructions given to the computer to check if the written circumstance is true or false. We can think about a situation where a child needs to do the homework every afternoon as an example. The parents will check it before tea time, and if it happens, the kid will be allowed to play with a videogame; if not, they will all sit down together and solve the problem. In the other instance, loops are cycles through the data until a specified condition is met, like a child who is playing on a hot summer day. He can bike twice around the field, but after the second cycle is completed, the child needs to stop near their mom and drink a cup of water.</p>
            <p>Functions are also essential to our coding. These will group a block of instructions in a logical order to perform an action, almost a list of instructions - think of it as the following recipe. Once it has been set, it is necessary to call it with the job result. They are essential because it is where it is stored in procedures, methods, variables and even classes and modules.</p>
            <p>And lastly, but not less important, I would like to cover some info for arrays and objects. These two are commonly showing up inside functions to perform a looping or a conditional.</p>
            <p>Arrays can get compared to a list - composed of words (strings) or numbers. They are defined by everything inside brackets [], separated by commas and counted as per index numbers. Index numbers mean that the first element of the list will get recognised as 0, the second as 1, the third ad 2, and it keeps going.</p>
            <p>On the other side, objects can also get compared to a list, but each element will have another list inside it. Think of it like an agenda phone grocery list, you will have the names as main keys, and inside each name, it is necessary to have a phone number, a mobile number and your friend’s address. However, their count is different to the arrays. So, if we need to pull through data from it, it is necessary to use the element to bring the correct data, such as ‘phone number’ or ‘address’.</p>
