            <h3>09 November 2021</h3>

            <p>Sooner or later everyone gets to a point in their lives where it is necessary to understand who they are. Explore your weaknesses, strengths and goals to figure out how to promote it all to fit your prospect of yourself in future. Remember to keep it positive - there will always be something else requiring development. After all, each self is constantly transforming.</p>
	        <p>Coming from a very multicultural country, Brazil, it was essential to recognise how important it is to be empathic and respectful to others beliefs and feelings. My cultural background is what made me successful in making so many friends and building my self-confidence in my judgments. I am a big believer in friendly greetings, small talks and adaptability to adversities. Respect, transparency, empathy, integrity and family are my ethical pillars.</p>
	        <p>I would like to tell you about this episode in my career where I faced the decision to fail one of my students at the end of the semester. Unfortunately, he struggled with the content despite all of my efforts trying to help him through reinforcements and after-class help. My evaluation was defined considering his results on several different exercises - individually and collectively - done at home and in classes. The coordinator of the course was not happy about it as she thought that only his presence at the school throughout all this time could justify his approval to the next level and let him pass. I was transparent to the school and the student about his situation, yet my point of view was neglected. It was indeed a shame, sadly he struggled even more with the new content as he hadn’t completely understood the first module.</p>
	        <p>Looking back, I made the best decision according to my conscience. It is what ethics are about, questioning, discovering and defending our values. Not always fun, but if we commit to it, these decisions mould who we are in the future.</p>
            <h2 class="Subtitles-post">Strengths</h2>
            <p>Now that you already know some brief information about me... Let’s get to my strengths. I do have strong opinions as you can see above, however, they’re far from closed-minded. Everyone has the right to voice their truth and discuss subjects - it is how we add value to the collective environment. I am passionate about life, proactive, well organised and dedicated. Every task done by me will have 100% of my effort. I hate the feeling of letting anyone down, including myself.</p>
            <p>Sometimes, I can get too excited and overwhelmed with several activities, though. Proactivity means that I am usually multitasking as well. I worry that my wanting to learn as much as possible may limit me in terms of depth, and deciding where I would like to focus my time and efforts. And I also struggle with perfectionism as I can procrastinate over details.</p>
            <p>Well, that’s why reflections are here: help to keep track if I am getting better on these points following small steps every day to overcome the limits. Life is a journey, and each new episode of it will add more and more learnings to who you are and what you would like to become. </p>
            <h2 class="Subtitles-post">Working collaboratively</h2>
	        <p>Although I don’t usually have tensions with people, it can happen to come from others when they are feeling stressed, overwhelmed or not considerate to others. Particularly, I believe to have the ability to guide people working together in service of the greater good.</p>
            <p>As an example, I would like to talk about this situation where my colleague felt under a lot of pressure, and wouldn’t do the job that we were supposed to be delivering on that same day. When my task was finished, I needed his assignment to be able to go through the next step. My coworker had a big reaction and refused to respond to me or anyone else in the team. Well, I decided that it was time for a break, and although the situation was chaotic, we needed to sort this problem to function again. We went out to have a cup of coffee at a place close by and opened up about how we were feeling about this work.</p>
            <p>That is a great example of how I believe that we all should be emphatic with others’ feelings. It was the best way that I could think about sorting it out, and it worked. He was feeling overwhelmed with the workload for more than a week (final project deadline) and couldn’t handle it well. However, my approach reconnected him with the team again, and he felt better when we got back to work. We did three extra overtime hours to finish it but ended up well at the end. After this episode, I sat down with our manager at the time and asked him to review the system procedures for the next deadline.</p>
