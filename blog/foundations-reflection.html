            <h2>Learning & Ego</h2>
            <p>
                I always knew that perfection was present in my life, but during foundations, I felt like I was too hard on myself. It is essential to remain calm and take your own time, but the feeling of frustration would show up whenever it was necessary to reach out for help. Funny, because I thought I had it completely under control, but new situations usually also bring new learnings.
            </p>
            <p>
                In addition to that, celebration - when achieving a solution - is a tool that cheers me up! And yes, I am great at writing down a plan and following it. Besides all of it, the concept of mindset helped me to understand better about my feelings and how to deal with them. I do now have a journal where I keep writing about my emotions throughout the day.
            </p>
            
            <h2>Role of values, empathy and self-awareness</h2>
            <p>
                Same as in other areas of our lives. They are essential to keep our connections in society and also towards ourselves. Without understanding about own values, it is impossible to comprehend how you see yourself. They are important as guidance of our beliefs, attitudes and behaviour.
            </p>
            <p>
                Empathy is putting yourself in other people's shoes. So then you will be able to deal better with the situations considering how they feel. It is also related to what has been listened, and how you respond to the feelings. Be patient, including with yourself. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Lastly, there is self-awareness. Which is applying reflections of our values and feelings towards ourselves. I struggled with it during the foundations a few times, but there is always space for improvement. We can work on each one of these aspects to make sure that they are present in our daily lives.
            </p>

            <h2>Core Learning</h2>
            <p>
                The core learning during foundations was very reflexive with reading and video materials. These would only offer some base, but the real work was on yourself. There was a lot of reflection about how I see myself, my connections and bring peace to my mind. There were many new concepts that I was surprised for already being present in my life, but I wasn’t aware of its designation. It is what surprised me the most. The overall experience was indeed fantastic about self-knowledge and very challenging to put my emotions in words. At least at the beginning, it seems more natural now.
            </p>
            <p>
                I see that the course is pretty intense, considering the amount of info that we need to study in such a short period. It is important to keep the core activities to force ourselves of disconnecting from all of it and focus on well being again. There is also the aspect of making sure that we know how to work in teams. Companies nowadays value exceptional human beings who enhance the culture of their team. The content was essential to help me to keep focused on my leadership skills as well.
