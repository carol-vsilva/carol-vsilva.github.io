                Neuroplasticity refers to the brain’s ability to change and adapt based on experiences. It helps to learn new things; enhance the existing cognitive capabilities; recover from brain injures (such as strokes or trauma); strengthen areas in which functions are lost or decline; promote brain fitness. I currently use it to learn new things, and it works when there is a lot of practice involved. Not only when studying, but also reflecting about what had been done later in the day without checking the content. The brain will exercise this new capability by picturing what was done and repeating it mentally.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another way of assimilating new content better is making analogies or looking for ways of putting it in context. After all, learning is the formation of new or stronger neural connections, so using something which already exists inside their brain is a good way of exercising it. Lastly, but not less important, is the necessity of showing how the brain works. This action might break some myth barriers of intelligence being predetermined, and encourage people to keep working on the goal.

                A growth mindset can be related to this last point. It is the belief that people’s abilities are constantly improving. No knowledge is set in stone - everything can get sharpened with the right effort and development. People learn from different concepts, timing and practices as each individual is unique. Well, nothing is impossible, you are just not there yet! Keep trying.
            </p>

                This discussion is relevant because efforts come from our minds. If you don’t think that “it is possible to do it”, a block will get raised - that’s how people get stuck and give up. If the persistency is ongoing, the person will keep looking for other related content. That is how different explanations and practical exercises get found. Adding all this info to the brain, it is when the new data will get developed and add new perspectives. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Regarding my studies, I wasn’t surprised when I read about the growth mindset. It only gave me the certainty that learning is a process. It is necessary to work hard on routines to integrate some patterns into the brain, and discipline helps with the constancy of the studies. Both mindsets are currently getting used during my journey on this course.
