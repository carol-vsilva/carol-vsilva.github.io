            <p>Emotional intelligence, or EQ, is the capacity of understanding feelings and be able to deal with them calmly. It is the ability to distinguish, control, and evaluate emotions from yourself or others around you.</p>
	        <p>Intelligence quotient, or IQ, on the other hand, is the ability or finding problems using logic and rational answers. Therefore, this intelligence uses only the general factor, and it doesn’t embrace the full range of human capabilities.</p>
	        <p>With EQ, humans can use empathy not only towards themselves but also be aware of how others feel. The self-awareness of these individuals contributes to understanding their own emotions and their states of being. Not to mention, studies show that englobing all the described above, people think better before reacting as they will use all of these skills on typical life situations. There is nothing more important than putting yourself on someone’s else feet when living in society.</p>
