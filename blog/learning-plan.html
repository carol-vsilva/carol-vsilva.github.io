            <h3>18 November 2021</h3>

            <p>My long goal pathway is to keep myself doing works which I can see a purpose when linking it to my values and/or perspective of the future. I also plan to be working remotely in a few years to fit my plans of travelling around the world. Meanwhile, I still can’t see an area that interests me the most as we have just started the course, but I would like to keep using my skills in leading people. My limitations are linked to my multitask attitude and perfectionism. However, I have plans to keep both of them under control with tools such as tracking time. My strengths are being determined and being well organised.</p>
            <p>During the course, we will explore the core content. I believe that it will help me to improve my writing skills. As well as understand me better to find ways of connecting to people. Its sublinks bring good discussions to start conversations within the cohort and a better idea of the overall environment that learning is. I am looking forward to using these skills in person with my colleges during Bootcamp.</p>
            <p>About the planned schedule, I am currently studying from 6 pm to 11 pm Mon-Fri, plus eight hours per day on Sat and Sun. It is an exhausting timeline, but it is the only way it fits my schedule - I am still completing the resignation period from work. I had the possibility of starting the content a few days before the beginning of the course. That’s why I am glad to say that I consider having plenty of time to reschedule things if necessary. Anyway, the summer break will be very welcomed in my case to have a refresh.</p>
            <p>In the following period, Bootcamp, the main plan is to be available from 8 am to 5 pm Mon-Fri at Re-Leased and use the spare time during the nights to work on the content that needs some more attention. It will probably be necessary to add at least 5h studying on Saturdays too. I am also including some brief breaks to check on my mental health and consolidate my relationship with the group - cohort and Re-Leased.</p>
            <p>Regarding my communication with the community, I realised that slack is used mostly during the daytime. So, it is open even when I am at work to keep an eye on how things are going for my cohort. There is also a 30 min discussion with my facilitator every Thursday to follow up about the content.</p>
            <p>If we consider any time that I will be struggling, my first option would be to find help from other people. When things are building up, the plan is to stop what I am doing and reschedule the agenda again to find better solutions to my timeline. It can be more time studying or organising some time off with friends in the tech world. Other perspectives can be the difference to find a solution on what I will be facing.</p>
	        <p>Right now, I count on my partner with my basic questions. He is also a software developer, and he is usually studying by my side during the nighttime. Yet, I believe that I will find the same help during Bootcamp with people at Re-Leased along with my cohort. Also, not forget about the facilitators. They are available in case that I have any doubts or can’t seem to find the right solutions. Depending on the timeline, it would also be good to discuss concepts and bring examples to demonstrate the situation in real life.</p>

                My long career path looks pretty similar to the previous one. I would rather find remote opportunities and develop subjects that are valuable to me. Regarding the area, I noticed that I am good at rewriting and reviewing codes during the foundations. Perhaps this might be a good path to follow. Anyway, there will surely be several other aspects that will get developed during Bootcamp. I can't wait!
            </p>
            <p>
                Foundations content also helped me to understand better my limitations towards myself. There was a lot of learning about how to deal with challenges, frustrations, problem-solving and attention to detail. Coding is a lot about logic, persistence and learning new languages. It seems like an exciting thing to keep doing. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The core activities are improving my writing skills and helping me to improve my mental condition. I now have practices such as having a journal with all of my feelings or meditation sessions. It was also a big discovery to learn that I am not as self-aware as I thought I would be. These new habits will be helpful during the Bootcamp pressure and timeline.
            </p>
            <p>
                Well, I keep working hard to have perfectionism under control. And the new activities will bring some presentations in public and pairing exercises. I am counting that these will enhance my skills and develop leadership. This Xmas break is more than welcome to refresh my brain before loading up again for two months.
            </p>
            <p>
                The plan over Bootcamp is make a good network, learn new skills, practice tech concepts and do not get too overwhelmed. It looks possible as I am finally done with my previous job, and there is plenty of time to focus on the current discussions. The plan shows that we will be in touch to many other students as well, which makes me happy. I also expect to learn different areas inside the tech industry to understand where I would fit better. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The timebox will be from 8 am to 5.30 pm from Monday to Friday + 3h per day on weekdays. I also can add up to 5h on the weekends to complement if necessary. After the thought timeline with Foundations, I would like to maintain some rest breaks clearer on the plan. The support will also change a bit. More connections may be constructed to the Academy and Re-Leased by how much time I am spending in their companies. My partner and friends can get consulted at any time as well.
