            <h3>18 November 2021</h3>

            <p>My long goal pathway is to keep myself doing works which I can see a purpose when linking it to my values and/or perspective of the future. I also plan to be working remotely in a few years to fit my plans of travelling around the world. Meanwhile, I still can’t see an area that interests me the most as we have just started the course, but I would like to keep using my skills in leading people. My limitations are linked to my multitask attitude and perfectionism. However, I have plans to keep both of them under control with tools such as tracking time. My strengths are being determined and being well organised.</p>
            <p>During the course, we will explore the core content. I believe that it will help me to improve my writing skills. As well as understand me better to find ways of connecting to people. Its sublinks bring good discussions to start conversations within the cohort and a better idea of the overall environment that learning is. I am looking forward to using these skills in person with my colleges during Bootcamp.</p>
            <p>About the planned schedule, I am currently studying from 6 pm to 11 pm Mon-Fri, plus eight hours per day on Sat and Sun. It is an exhausting timeline, but it is the only way it fits my schedule - I am still completing the resignation period from work. I had the possibility of starting the content a few days before the beginning of the course. That’s why I am glad to say that I consider having plenty of time to reschedule things if necessary. Anyway, the summer break will be very welcomed in my case to have a refresh.</p>
            <p>In the following period, Bootcamp, the main plan is to be available from 8 am to 5 pm Mon-Fri at Re-Leased and use the spare time during the nights to work on the content that needs some more attention. It will probably be necessary to add at least 5h studying on Saturdays too. I am also including some brief breaks to check on my mental health and consolidate my relationship with the group - cohort and Re-Leased.</p>
            <p>Regarding my communication with the community, I realised that slack is used mostly during the daytime. So, it is open even when I am at work to keep an eye on how things are going for my cohort. There is also a 30 min discussion with my facilitator every Thursday to follow up about the content.</p>
            <p>If we consider any time that I will be struggling, my first option would be to find help from other people. When things are building up, the plan is to stop what I am doing and reschedule the agenda again to find better solutions to my timeline. It can be more time studying or organising some time off with friends in the tech world. Other perspectives can be the difference to find a solution on what I will be facing.</p>
	        <p>Right now, I count on my partner with my basic questions. He is also a software developer, and he is usually studying by my side during the nighttime. Yet, I believe that I will find the same help during Bootcamp with people at Re-Leased along with my cohort. Also, not forget about the facilitators. They are available in case that I have any doubts or can’t seem to find the right solutions. Depending on the timeline, it would also be good to discuss concepts and bring examples to demonstrate the situation in real life.</p>
